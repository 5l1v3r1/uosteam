# UOSteam

These are an assortment of scripts that run with the now depracated UO Assistant, UOSteam. 

These have been collected and some hand coded from various sources on the internet. 

If you happen to be one of the dozen of remaining UO players out there, please submit your own scripts if you'd like by submitting PR. 

## Issues

Due to the variety of private servers UOSteam works with some of these scripts may have trouble working, or could break the rules of your shard, use at your own risk, and open an issue if you need help. 

Have fun!
